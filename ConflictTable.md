# Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Requirements Conflict Table

Creating a **Requirements Conflict Table** helps identify, analyze, and resolve conflicts in requirements systematically. Follow these steps:

---

## **Step 1: Gather Requirements**
1. **Document All Requirements**  
   - Collect requirements from all stakeholders (e.g., customers, business teams, developers).  
   - Include functional, non-functional, and technical requirements.  
   - Use clear and concise language for each requirement.

2. **Assign Unique Identifiers**  
   - Label each requirement with a unique ID for easy tracking (e.g., `R1`, `R2`).

---

## **Step 2: Create the Table Structure**
Set up a table with the following columns:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Conflicting Requirement ID(s) | Conflict Description | Resolution Plan | Status |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| `R1`           | Description of R1       | `R2, R3`                      | Conflict details     | Resolution steps| Open/Resolved |

---

## **Step 3: Identify Potential Conflicts**
1. **Analyze Requirements for Overlaps**  
   - Look for conflicting goals, resource constraints, or technical feasibility issues.  
     - Example: One requirement demands high system speed (`R1`), while another (`R2`) requires heavy data processing, which may slow the system.

2. **Engage Stakeholders**  
   - Conduct discussions or workshops with stakeholders to identify conflicts.

3. **Record Conflicts**  
   - For each identified conflict, note:
     - Conflicting requirement IDs.
     - A description of the conflict (e.g., "R1 requires low latency, but R2 increases processing time.").

---

## **Step 4: Prioritize Conflicts**
1. **Assess Impact and Severity**  
   - High: Critical conflicts that block progress.  
   - Medium: Conflicts with potential workarounds.  
   - Low: Minor conflicts with minimal impact.

2. **Use Decision-Making Tools**  
   - Apply methods like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) or weighted scoring to prioritize resolution efforts.

---

## **Step 5: Propose Resolution Plans**
1. **Brainstorm Solutions**  
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to explore alternatives, compromises, or trade-offs.  
   - Example: "Reduce the scope of R2 to balance speed and processing."

2. **Document the Resolution Plan**  
   - Clearly outline the steps or changes required to resolve the conflict.

3. **Assign Ownership**  
   - Allocate responsibilities for resolving the conflict to specific team members or stakeholders.

---

## **Step 6: Track and Update Status**
1. **Monitor Progress**  
   - Update the table with the status of each conflict (`Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`).  
   - Include notes on resolution outcomes or new conflicts that arise.

2. **Communicate Regularly**  
   - Share updates with stakeholders to ensure alignment.

---

## **Step 7: Review and Iterate**
1. **Conduct Regular Reviews**  
   - Revisit the Requirements Conflict Table during project checkpoints to identify new conflicts or adjust resolutions as needed.

2. **Refine and Improve**  
   - Use feedback to enhance the conflict resolution process in future projects.

## Example Table

Here’s an example of a completed Requirements Conflict Table:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                | Conflicting Requirement ID(s) | Conflict Description                                      | Resolution Plan                              | Status     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| R1             | System response time < 2 seconds      | R2                            | Heavy data processing in R2 increases latency.           | Optimize processing or reduce data size.    | In Progress|
| R3             | Allow anonymous access to some data   | R4                            | R4 requires strict access control for all data.          | Define specific exceptions for R3.          | Open       |
| R5             | Implement feature within 3 months     | R6                            | R6 requires extensive testing that exceeds timeline.     | Reduce testing scope or extend deadline.    | Resolved   |

# Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Variability Model for a Large System

## Scenario: Smart Home Automation System
We are modeling variability for a **Smart Home Automation System** (SHAS), which supports diverse devices like lights, thermostats, cameras, and door locks. The system is customizable to fit different user preferences, environments, and budgets.

---

## **Step 1: Understand the System Domain**
1. **Analyze the Domain**  
   - Understand the features, functions, and constraints of the system.  
     Example for SHAS: Smart devices include lights, cameras, thermostats, door locks, and sensors.

2. **Identify Stakeholders**  
   - Determine all relevant stakeholders and their needs (e.g., homeowners, manufacturers, developers, installers).

3. **Define Objectives**  
   - Clarify why variability is important:
     - Allow customization for different home sizes.
     - Support different device brands and protocols.
     - Enable optional features like voice control or advanced security.

---

## **Step 2: Identify Variability Drivers**
1. **User-Driven Variability**  
   - Features users can select based on preferences:
     - Light automation (on/off scheduling, dimming, or RGB color).
     - Security modes (standard or advanced).  

2. **Environment-Driven Variability**  
   - Features dependent on the user's environment:
     - Number of devices per room.
     - Network type (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave).  

3. **Technology-Driven Variability**  
   - Features based on technical differences:
     - Device compatibility (brands and protocols).  
     - Cloud vs. local storage for data.

---

## **Step 3: Define the System’s Feature Model**
Create a feature hierarchy to represent mandatory, optional, and alternative features.

### Example Feature Model for SHAS:
- **Smart Home Automation System**
  - **Lighting System**
    - On/Off Scheduling (Mandatory)
    - Dimming (Optional)
    - RGB Color Control (Optional)
  - **Security System**
    - Camera Surveillance (Mandatory)
      - Cloud Storage (Optional)
      - Local Storage (Optional)
    - Door Locks (Optional)
  - **Climate Control**
    - Thermostat (Optional)
      - Basic Temperature Control (Alternative)
      - Advanced Climate Scheduling (Alternative)

---

## **Step 4: Create a Variability Matrix**
Map features to variability drivers and stakeholders.

| Feature               | User-Driven | Environment-Driven | Technology-Driven | Stakeholders     |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| On/Off Scheduling     | Yes         | No                  | No                | Homeowners       |
| RGB Color Control     | Yes         | No                  | Yes               | Developers       |
| Cloud Storage         | No          | No                  | Yes               | Manufacturers    |
| Thermostat            | Yes         | Yes                 | No                | Homeowners       |

---

## **Step 5: Model Constraints and Dependencies**
1. **Define Constraints**  
   - If Feature A is selected, Feature B must also be selected.  
     Example: RGB Color Control requires Dimming.  

2. **Define Exclusions**  
   - If Feature A is selected, Feature B cannot be selected.  
     Example: Cloud Storage excludes Local Storage.

3. **Model Dependencies in Tools**  
   - Use UML, FeatureIDE, or other tools to visually represent relationships between features.

---

## **Step 6: Choose a Modeling Language**
1. **Select a Notation**  
   - Feature models, decision models, or use UML diagrams.
   - Example tools:
     - **FeatureIDE**: Ideal for hierarchical feature models.
     - **SPLE (Software Product Line Engineering)** tools for complex systems.

2. **Draw the Variability Model**  
   - Include:
     - Features and subfeatures.
     - Mandatory, optional, and alternative features.
     - Constraints and dependencies.

---

## **Step 7: Validate the Variability Model**
1. **Simulate Configurations**  
   - Test different combinations of feature selections for validity.  
     Example: Ensure selecting RGB Color Control activates Lighting System.

2. **Get Stakeholder Feedback**  
   - Present the model to stakeholders to ensure it aligns with their needs.

3. **Refine the Model**  
   - Make adjustments based on feedback and testing results.

---

## **Step 8: Implement the Model**
1. **Use Variability Mechanisms**  
   - Implement variability in code (e.g., feature toggles, plugins, dependency injection).

2. **Track Configurations**  
   - Maintain records of valid and invalid configurations for future reference.

---

## **Step 9: Maintain and Evolve the Model**
1. **Update the Model**  
   - Add or remove features based on user feedback or market trends.  
     Example: Add new features like voice control or energy-saving modes.

2. **Periodically Validate**  
   - Ensure the model remains consistent with the actual system.
