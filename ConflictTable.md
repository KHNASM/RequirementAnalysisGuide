# Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Requirements Conflict Table

Creating a **Requirements Conflict Table** helps identify, analyze, and resolve conflicts in requirements systematically. Follow these steps:

---

## **Step 1: Gather Requirements**
1. **Document All Requirements**  
   - Collect requirements from all stakeholders (e.g., customers, business teams, developers).  
   - Include functional, non-functional, and technical requirements.  
   - Use clear and concise language for each requirement.

2. **Assign Unique Identifiers**  
   - Label each requirement with a unique ID for easy tracking (e.g., `R1`, `R2`).

---

## **Step 2: Create the Table Structure**
Set up a table with the following columns:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Conflicting Requirement ID(s) | Conflict Description | Resolution Plan | Status |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| `R1`           | Description of R1       | `R2, R3`                      | Conflict details     | Resolution steps| Open/Resolved |

---

## **Step 3: Identify Potential Conflicts**
1. **Analyze Requirements for Overlaps**  
   - Look for conflicting goals, resource constraints, or technical feasibility issues.  
     - Example: One requirement demands high system speed (`R1`), while another (`R2`) requires heavy data processing, which may slow the system.

2. **Engage Stakeholders**  
   - Conduct discussions or workshops with stakeholders to identify conflicts.

3. **Record Conflicts**  
   - For each identified conflict, note:
     - Conflicting requirement IDs.
     - A description of the conflict (e.g., "R1 requires low latency, but R2 increases processing time.").

---

## **Step 4: Prioritize Conflicts**
1. **Assess Impact and Severity**  
   - High: Critical conflicts that block progress.  
   - Medium: Conflicts with potential workarounds.  
   - Low: Minor conflicts with minimal impact.

2. **Use Decision-Making Tools**  
   - Apply methods like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) or weighted scoring to prioritize resolution efforts.

---

## **Step 5: Propose Resolution Plans**
1. **Brainstorm Solutions**  
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to explore alternatives, compromises, or trade-offs.  
   - Example: "Reduce the scope of R2 to balance speed and processing."

2. **Document the Resolution Plan**  
   - Clearly outline the steps or changes required to resolve the conflict.

3. **Assign Ownership**  
   - Allocate responsibilities for resolving the conflict to specific team members or stakeholders.

---

## **Step 6: Track and Update Status**
1. **Monitor Progress**  
   - Update the table with the status of each conflict (`Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`).  
   - Include notes on resolution outcomes or new conflicts that arise.

2. **Communicate Regularly**  
   - Share updates with stakeholders to ensure alignment.

---

## **Step 7: Review and Iterate**
1. **Conduct Regular Reviews**  
   - Revisit the Requirements Conflict Table during project checkpoints to identify new conflicts or adjust resolutions as needed.

2. **Refine and Improve**  
   - Use feedback to enhance the conflict resolution process in future projects.

## Example Table

Here’s an example of a completed Requirements Conflict Table:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                | Conflicting Requirement ID(s) | Conflict Description                                      | Resolution Plan                              | Status     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| R1             | System response time < 2 seconds      | R2                            | Heavy data processing in R2 increases latency.           | Optimize processing or reduce data size.    | In Progress|
| R3             | Allow anonymous access to some data   | R4                            | R4 requires strict access control for all data.          | Define specific exceptions for R3.          | Open       |
| R5             | Implement feature within 3 months     | R6                            | R6 requires extensive testing that exceeds timeline.     | Reduce testing scope or extend deadline.    | Resolved   |
